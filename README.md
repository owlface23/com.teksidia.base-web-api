# Web API Starter Solution #

This is a no-frills, zero-bloat ASP.NET Web API solution to help you get your web API project started quickly.

It uses OWIN running on IIS and includes the excellent [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle), which seamlessly gets [Swagger](http://swagger.io) incorporated (allowing you to self document and test your API).
